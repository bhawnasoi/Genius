# Team Genuis Proposal
## Introduction
Music offers a multitude of benefits for people of every age , particularly for the elderly population . It works as a therapy to increase memory function, relax the body , reduce muscle tension and boost productivity. Our idea is to create a music app especially for elders to help them record their music which can thus help them recover their speech and also overcome dementia by recalling music . Singing and recording  music will allow self-expression and then sharing that with their community ,friends and family. The other users of the app could be the listeners who like old songs. For elders listening to music can relieve them from boredom. While listening to music , tapping foot or clapping with rhythm encourages movement. The other benefit that can be reaped is creating a large social network and recalling and sharing stories associated with the songs. 
## Concept 
Idea
Many young people use their different kind of music APPs to share their favorite music or some art form, for example, iTunes, music box, Spotify so on. They enjoy and share a wide variety of music, share their own lives. Young people learn and master new technology quickly and easily, they are keen to understand new things.
However, technology is accelerating at an extreme pace, and the seniors can't keep up. So found the way to make aging people enjoy the technology as the first question for our group.
At the same time, we also consider the aging people have more life experience means more knowledge, practice, and experience to draw on. So base on this idea, we decided to design a simple, easy to use APP for aging to use and share traditional music and operas with their own stories, photos, different topics, and emotions. Older people can enjoy the convenience of science and technology, at the same time, this APP would seeking hints of music or art forms that could disappear as change continues.
Project aims&Audience
Our target audience is age from 60 to 100 years old people who have a rich life experience, happy to share music and their stories and experiences with young people and their peers. The target audience also could be keen on the inheritance and continuation of music.
The goal of this project is to develop a music, life, and memories sharing software for the elderly. This APP uses voice control function and simple use of the interface to facilitate the utilization of the elderly so that the aging people could feel the fun and convenience of the technology.
Innovation
       Target group
According to our research, In the 18 months starting July 2008, when Apple updated the iOS to support native apps, and ending in January 2010, nearly 150,000 apps were released. That's around 275 apps per day. In so many massive amounts of mobile phone software, music software accounted for 40% of the number (live wire,2010).In this 40% of the software inside, most of the design groups are for young people. For example iTunes, For you, Tidal, Spotify and so on. And for the elderly involved in the software is only has 1%. So our innovation is to target the group for the aging people.
       Sharing anything with music
This app is a music app, but also could share the anything you want with music. Such as photos, stories, a piece of voice messages or others.
       Voice control
Aging people are difficult to learn and accept new technology, so to make the elderly more convenient to use the software. We used the voice control when designing the software. So that the aging people in the utilization of the software when it is not necessary to type. This function is increasing user experience.
       Upload own song
The user could share any songs/operas on this app. At the same time, the user also could upload own songs and rearrange the songs with other users.
       Unique emoji function
Consider the poor, elderly eyesight; we add the emoji function. When the user clicks the different big emoji form, the app will provide the different music depending on options selected by users, at the same time, the phone vibrates during in every time selected emoji form by users.For example：
          ：pleasant music
    ：Sad music
    ：Nature sounds

       Mobile buzzes function
-    The phone will autumnally vibrate following the music beats.
-    If the user selected any options, the phone would vibrate to remind the user selected the options success.
       The speaker phone function
Along with increased age, severe hearing loss among aged people exacerbates problems in their daily life. Therefore, we add a speakerphone function on the APP, so the user would easily hear the music.
Identify areas of social & mobile theory
When there's a sudden tech revolution, you have to unlearn what you've already learned, which takes more time than learning about something new from scratch. This phenomenon is especially true for people over 50 because around that age the brain starts to lose plasticity (the ability to form and change neural connections into new ones).Therefore, aging people slowly start losing touch with new technology. Missed many opportunities to meet new friends, sharing memories, get new information and life online, and enjoy the convenience and joy of technology.
This app can make aging people to sharing their music, memories, and life to others. Let the elderly have their cyberspace to meet individuals with the same hobbies, or to pass on their favorite music to others.


## Team
Who is on your team, what are their responsibilities, and how will you work together? List all the
members and their course code. Identify: 
* Who will lead the team and manage the project; 
* Who is responsible for logistics e.g. equipment, meetings, transport, etc; 
* Who fills key roles, e.g. back end, front end, content, design;
* How will decisions be made;
* How will the team handle poor performance and resolve conflicts. 
## Communication
Where and when will your team meet and how will you all communicate? Where will files 1
be stored and shared? What are the file naming conventions?
Identify the social platform/s your team has adopted and explain the choice. How will it facilitate
communication and / or file sharing? 

### Meetings
* Meetings are held during the contact weekly and additional meeting is considered if it is necessary.The additional meeting should be proved by every teammember and the time will be decided based on the available schedule of the whole team,ensuring everyone can attend the meeting.
* Every team member should need to report what they had done in the last week,what they are doing right now and what they are going to do in the weekly meeting during the contact session,making sure that the team project is on track.
* A at least 24-hours meeting notice should be given which involves meeting location,time and meeting contents.Hence,team members can prepare to the meeting.Every team member is required to attend the meeting except for reasonable reasons and a 24-hour notice should be given through Facebook group to the team members.
* If a team member sledom reply any Facebook messages or contribute to the team,a warming would be given to him/her at first.If continued failure to comply,the team would disscus with tutor about current situation and probobaly take further actions on Peer Assessments.

### Tools
* Facebook message would be the primary instance communication channel for project notification and project management because every teammember has their Facebook account on their phone,ensuring all the newest updates of project can be known by every team member at the first time and nothing urgent is missed.In addition,every team member should give respond within 24 hour.
* Slack would be used as well,sice it's not mobile and less convinience comparing with Facebook message.Because all the DECO2800 tutors are on slack which it is useful for the team to seek help from tutors and to solve problems,the Slack is considered as secondary communication channels.
* Google drive and Github would be used as support tool for sharing resources online and since it will have record for each one's contribution and the team can identify the current project easily from the records and adjust the workload.Also,Google drive and Github allowing multiple people working on the same document at the same time which can improve the team efficiency dreamatically.
### Naming Convention
The default naming convention for all the files would be :TEAMNAME_XXX
## Plan
 Identify the key tasks that need to be completed and when. Identify:
* Project phases e.g. research; requirements; design; construction;
* Key deliverables for each phase (Milestones) ; 2
* Resources – equipment or other tools/people you might need.
